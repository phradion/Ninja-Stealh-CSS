This little snippet is created to work with Joni Korpi's LessFramework and SASS language (http://sass-lang.com/).

The basic idea is that you often want to hide/display/expand to full width a certain block of text/image/element depends on the current resolutions of users' browsers. For example, you may want to expand your banner in the left column to full width on an iPhone screen.

This is designed to work with LessFramework 3. As LessFramework 5 is under development, I'll wait until its release then update the code to accommodate with the newer version.

File Structures
 /README - instruction
 /main.scss - The main base scss file, this is your central css file.
 /_ninja.scss - the core of Ninja Stealth :)
 /_reset.scss - it's written for generic purpose and is based on Blueprint's reset so I decide to include it here.
 /_colors.scss - put your colour variables in here.
 /_utility.scss - put your utility variables and blocks in here. Included as a bonus, not that vital.
 /lessframework3.css - The original lessframework3 file included for comparison with the main.scss. You can remove it from your production environment.
 
How to compile:
Run this command 
sass --watch main.scss:main.css

And you should not be worry about other files that starts with underscore as they are automatically compiled by SASS and included to the final css file.

Check out http://JMango.net for a real life example. Try resizing the website slowly you will start to see blocks moving around/become hidden or take full width.
